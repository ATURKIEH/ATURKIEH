# Hi, I'm Aref 👋

**Computer Science Student | Systems, Backend & Security-Oriented Engineering**  
📍 Western University, Canada  

I’m a Computer Science student with strong interests in **systems programming**, **backend engineering**, and **performance-aware software design**.  
I enjoy working close to the hardware — from **C & Assembly (ARM/x86)** to **concurrent Java systems**, while also exploring **cybersecurity**, **AI**, and **financial systems (FinTech)**.
